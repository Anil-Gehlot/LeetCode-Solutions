# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. These solutions are aimed at helping me and others prepare for coding interviews and improve problem-solving skills.

## About LeetCode

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a platform for preparing technical coding interviews. It offers a vast collection of coding problems covering various topics such as algorithms, data structures, database, system design, and more. Solving LeetCode problems is an excellent way to practice coding skills and prepare for coding interviews with top tech companies.

## Repository Structure

- Each problem solution is organized in its own directory.
- Inside each directory, you'll find the solution file(s) along with any necessary additional files (e.g., input files, supporting scripts).
- Solutions are implemented in various programming languages such as Python, Java, etc.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the directory of the problem you want to explore.
2. Open the solution file(s) using a text editor or an IDE.
3. Read the problem statement and understand the solution logic.
4. Test the solution with your custom test cases or LeetCode's test cases.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are welcome! If you have an alternative solution to a problem or have found a more optimized approach, feel free to contribute by following these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Implement your changes and ensure all existing tests pass.
4. Add comments and explanations if necessary.
5. Submit a pull request.

## Disclaimer

Please note that these solutions are provided for learning and reference purposes. While LeetCode encourages sharing solutions, it is essential to understand and solve the problems independently to gain maximum benefit and improve problem-solving skills.

## Support

If you find any issues with the solutions or have any questions, feel free to open an issue. Your feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
